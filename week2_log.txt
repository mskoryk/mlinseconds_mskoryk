The work log for the week2 problem (helloXor in 10 steps):
* grid search over the following parameters:
	** learning rate, weight decay, momentum
* try different optimizer (Adam)
* try different loss function (log-loss)
* try different activation functions (tanh, relu and sigmoid)
* try different coefficients inside the activation functions

It leads to a solution of 4.8 steps
